# React Assessment
 
This is my GitHub repository for my React assessment.

### Review questions ###

**1. What did you like about this project?**

   While the project was challenging and the programming in a JS used in a HTML vs in a React app somehow somewhat seem a little different, it was still interesting.

**2. What did you struggle with in this project?**

   I was confused about the props each component should receive etc. It was challenging as the examples taught during class had fewer components as compared to this project, so the complexity was greater with the interlinking of more components.

**3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?**

   While the [move to switch to a kanban project](https://www.codecademy.com/article/change-log-web-development#heading-what-are-the-specific-changes-5) allows us to be exposed to the concept, it would be great to have more detailed instructions that we usually see in the Codecademy modules, for this is quite a massive project for fresh starters like us who do not possess a good foundation of React yet.
